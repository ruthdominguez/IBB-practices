# BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS OF SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOME DATA
## IBB internship

This repository contains the R code elaborated by Ruth Dom√≠nguez during the internship on IBB institude analysing transcriptomic single-cell data to study the correlation betwen spatial pleiotropy and different parameters. The parameters analysed were essentiallity, gene functions (Gene Ontology), connectivity, phylostratum and adaptation.

The code is in R markdown and html formats so it can be downloaded and visualized properly.
